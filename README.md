# Machine Learning Model Analysis and Feature Selection

This repository contains implementations and analysis of various machine learning techniques focusing on:
- Regularization and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest Analysis

## Project Structure
- `models/`: Contains the main implementation files
  - `regularization_rfe.py`: Implementation of regularization and feature selection
  - `svr_rf_analysis.py`: SVR and Random Forest model implementations
- `plotting_utils.py`: Visualization utilities
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages
- `LICENSE`: MIT License file

## Features
1. Regularization and RFE Analysis
   - Implementation of different regularization techniques
   - Feature selection using RFE
   - Visualization of feature importance

2. SVR and Random Forest Implementation
   - Support Vector Regression analysis
   - Random Forest model implementation
   - Model comparison and evaluation

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The project contains two main analysis modules:
1. Regularization and Feature Selection (`models/regularization_rfe.py`)
2. SVR and Random Forest Analysis (`models/svr_rf_analysis.py`)
